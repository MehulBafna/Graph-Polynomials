Independence polynomial 

To delve into the concept of independence polynomial, it is required to go through the notion of independent sets.  

For a given graph G = (V,E), a vertex subset V′⊆ V is termed as an independent set if the graph induced by V′ i.e., G[V′] is an empty graph. 
The independent set with the maximum cardinality is defined as the maximum independent set and the cardinality of such maximum independent set is described as independence number denoted by α(G).

For a given graph G = (V,E), independence polynomial in terms of independent sets and independence number is defined as I(G,x) = ∑m<sub>j</sub>(G)x<sup>j</sup> where the coefficients mj(G)gives the total number of independent sets with cardinalityj,∀j∈{0,···,α(G)}
