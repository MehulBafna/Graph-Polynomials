Independence and Domination polynomials - Graph Theory

Graph polynomials are a vital concept in algebraic graph theory. Two of such polynomials are the Independence polynomial and domination polynomial. 

Independence polynomial

For a given graph G= (V,E) with V and E as vertex and edge set respectively, a vertex subset V′ ⊆ V is termed as an independent set if the graph induced by V′ i.e., G[V′] is an empty graph.  
The independent set with the maximum cardinality is defined as the maximum independent set and the cardinality of such maximum independent set is described as independence number denoted by α(G).

Domination polynomial

Open neighborhood (N(v)) :∀ v ∈ V ,N(v) = {u ∈ V| {u,v} ∈ E}

Closed neighborhood (N[v]) :N(v)∪{v} 

A vertex subset V′ ⊆ V is termed as a dominating set if N[V′] = V. The dominating set with the minimum cardinality is defined as minimum dominating set and cardinality of such minimum independentset is described as domination number which is denoted by γ(G).
